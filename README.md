# Fundamental frequency detection
Python code to detect the fundamental frequency in harmonic tremor, as used in the publication  __"Characteristics of current-induced harmonic tremor signals in ocean bottom seismometer records"__   by David Essing, Vera Schlindwein, Mechita C. Schmidt-Aursch, Celine Hadziioannou, Simon C. Stähler; in _Seismologcal Research Letters,_ 2021  

If you use this code, we would appreciate a citation of the article! 

The algorithm is based on the work described in Roman, D. C. (2017), "Automated detection and characterization of harmonic tremor in continuous seismic data", _Geophys. Res. Lett._, 44, 6065–6073.
