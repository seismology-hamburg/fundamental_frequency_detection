# Fundamental frequency detection
Python code for fundamental frequency detection in harmonic tremor used in Essing, D et al. (2019), Characteristics of current-induced harmonic tremor signals in ocean bottom seismometer records, SRL. Theory for the code is based on Roman, D. C. (2017), Automated detection and characterization of harmonic tremor in continuous seismic data, Geophys. Res. Lett., 44, 6065â€“6073.
